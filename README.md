# BlogZue - A React + Vite Blogging Platform

Welcome to BlogZue, a modern, fast, and intuitive blogging platform built with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and Appwrite. This project provides a seamless blogging experience, with a focus on performance and user experience.

## Features

- **Fast Refresh**: BlogZue uses Vite's HMR (Hot Module Replacement) for a super-fast development experience. Changes in your code reflect instantly in your app.
- **Tailwind CSS**: We use Tailwind CSS for styling. It's a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.
- **Framer Motion**: For animations, we use Framer Motion. It's a production-ready motion library for React that aims to provide a simple and intuitive API.
- **Appwrite**: Appwrite is used as the backend for the application. It provides developers with a set of easy-to-use and integrate REST APIs to manage their core backend needs.
- **ESLint Rules**: We've integrated some ESLint rules to ensure code quality and consistency across the project.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with React and Vite, BlogZue leverages the latest in web development technology.
